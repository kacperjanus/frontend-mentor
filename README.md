## Introduction
This GitHub repo consists of my implementations to frontend challenges that can be found on [FrontendMentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

Each challenge has its own folder and is a separate Next JS project, since I treat these challenges as a good way to practice both Next.JS framework as well as Tailwind CSS.

The challenges have different level of difficulty and below you can find completed challenges with their difficulty levels:

## Getting Started

To examine my implementations, simply move to folder dedicated to the challenge and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
